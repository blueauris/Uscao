<p>The structure of some biological objects is represented by the
sequence of their constituents, where each part is denote by an
uppercase letter. Biologists are interested in decomposing a long
sequence into shorter ones called <i>primitives</i>.

<p>We say that a sequence S can be composed from a given set of primitives
P if there is a some sequence of (possibly repeated) primitives from
the set whose concatenation equals S.  Not necessarily all primitives
need be present. For instance the sequence <TT>ABABACABAAB</TT>can be
composed from the set of primitives <pre>
	   {A, AB, BA, CA, BBC}
</pre>

<p>The first K characters of S are the <i>prefix of S with length
K</i>.  Write a program which accepts as input a set of primitives and
a sequence of constituents and then computes the length of the longest
prefix that can be composed from primitives.

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: prefix</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

First, the input file contains the list (length 1..200) of primitives
(length 1..10) expressed as a series of space-separated strings of
upper-case characters on one or more lines. The list of primitives is
terminated by a line that contains nothing more than a period (`.').
No primitive appears twice in the list.

Then, the input file contains a sequence S (length 1..200,000)
expressed as one or more lines, none of which exceeds 76 letters
in length. The "newlines" (line terminators) are not part of the
string S.

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file prefix.in) </h3>

<pre>
A AB BA CA BBC
.
ABABACABAABC
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line containing an integer that is the length of the longest
prefix that can be composed from the set P.

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file prefix.out)</h3>

<pre>
11
</pre>
